									<h5>Founder of Company named "Porsche"</h5>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Ferdinand Porsche, born in 1875 in Maffersdorf (now in the Czech Republic), was a visionary automotive engineer whose innovations laid the foundation for one of the most iconic car brands in the world. After studying mechanical engineering, Porsche worked for several automotive companies, where he earned recognition for his pioneering designs, including the world’s first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle, the Lohner-Porsche Mixte, in 1900. In 1931, he founded his own engineering consultancy, Porsche GmbH, which initially focused on designing vehicles for other manufacturers, most notably creating the Volkswagen Beetle at the request of Adolf Hitler. The Beetle’s success established Porsche as a leading figure in automotive design.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 1948, after Ferdinand’s death, his son Ferry Porsche continued his legacy and led the creation of the first car to carry the Porsche name: the Porsche 356. Designed by Ferdinand’s former assistant, Erwin Komenda, the 356 marked the official birth of the Porsche brand. Under Ferry's leadership, the Porsche 911 followed, further cementing the company’s reputation for high-performance vehicles. Today, Porsche stands as a symbol of luxury, precision engineering, and innovation, with Ferdinand Porsche’s early contributions remaining central to its identity as a leading global car manufacturer. His work with Volkswagen and the creation of the Porsche 356 laid the groundwork for Porsche’s ongoing success in the automotive world.
